## **Project Check In.pdf**<br>
I utilized Google Slides to create the pages added onto the initial analysis for the project check in. I described the outcomes of the univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics. Many columns in my dataset are right-skewed with many outliers. At the same time, many of my columns are correlated. I also described the hypothesis tests I conducted. From the 1990s to the 2000s, there is not a significant difference in the unemployment rate. As for the 2000s to the 2010s and the 2010s to the 2020s, there was a significant difference in the unemployment rate. Lastly, I utilized many machine learning techniques. I performed a linear regression, logistoc regression, support vector classifier model, k-nearest neighbors classifier model, and decision tree classifier model. The best model for my data was the decision tree classifier model with an accuracy score of .8875.
